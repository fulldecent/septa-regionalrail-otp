- Will
- Mike Zaleski
- John Dezio
- John Holohan

## Discussion

 - Discussed my data collection and calculation process
 - They use ATDS for scheduling data
 - Several blind spots for Newark, Thorndale, Trenton lines (Northeast Corridor) shared with Amtrak
 - They can improve reporting accuracy in DE (self reporting time cards) by using free station guards to record times
 - Scheduling companies: TrainPlan (German), Quintek (Dutch), Oliver Wyman (Princeton, currently used)
 - Manual adjustments for construction planning is their main job when scheduling rail


How rail scheduling works

 - Effective date is 2013-12-15, 2014-04-06, and 4 times a year
 - Minus 6 weeks: distribute to printer
 - Minus 8 weeks: draft to engineers for picking (union rule)

## Things I can use

- [ ] Passenger counts after APC goes live
- [ ] Historical schedules from ATDS
- [ ] Fiscal calendar
- [ ] List of equipment used for each train

## Things I can do

- [ ] Analyze Amtrak's scheduling data vs. actual results
- [ ] Benchmark SEPTA vs. NY, Chicago, ... 
- [ ] Do they exclude any trains from their OTP reports?
  - [ ] Their OTP is broken out by train type, I could do this
- [ ] Report of best and worst trains at SEPTA
- [ ] Best timing for my reports is 60â€“90 days after schedule effective date ?!
- [ ] Increase verbosity of reports, do exception reporting to show specific issues
