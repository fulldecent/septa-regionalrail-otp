# SEPTA Regional Rail On-Time Performance Report

These reports use every train's arrival time from 2009 until present to recommend schedule changes for chronically late service. Reports created by [William Entriken](http://phor.net/) (not affiliated with SEPTA). Also see SEPTA's less detailed [official OTP reports](http://www.septa.org/service/rail/otp.html).

This GitHub project is a placeholder to publish the code from the http://phor.net/apps/septa/ website. Star for updates.
