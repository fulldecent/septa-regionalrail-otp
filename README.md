# SEPTA Regional Rail On-Time Performance Report

**This repository is the code for https://phor.net/apps/septa**

These reports use every train's arrival time from 2008 until present to recommend schedule changes for chronically late service. Reports created by [William Entriken](http://phor.net/) (not affiliated with SEPTA). Also see SEPTA's less detailed [official OTP reports](http://www.septa.org/service/rail/otp.html).

## Getting data

See the [database folder](https://github.com/fulldecent/septa-regionalrail-otp/tree/master/website/databases) for details on how to get updated schedules and train lateness data from SEPTA.

## Running the site

Install the `website` folder on a PHP web server.

## Why am I doing this?

I set up this project to contribute major changes to SEPTA's 2008 rail schedule. OTP was a significant problem then and progress has since improved greatly.

I would like SEPTA to hire me on a monthly retainer to analyze and recommend changes to their schedule based on this and other information.

## Contributing

Please send PRs for things you would like to improve. I'd be happy to review your work if you are bringing significant effort to this project.
